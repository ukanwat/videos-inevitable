0.12,2.92,2.80,"Okay, so why were AI agents inevitable?"
3.02,4.28,1.26,2017.
5.44,6.56,1.12,Google drops this paper.
7.08,8.40,1.32,Attention is all you need.
8.96,9.96,1.00,And here's what's wild.
10.54,12.22,1.68,This wasn't just another research paper.
12.78,14.06,1.28,This was the first domino.
14.72,15.82,1.10,And nobody saw it coming.
16.60,19.06,2.46,Because what happened next wasn't planned.
20.34,22.64,2.30,Each breakthrough unlocked something incredible.
23.32,25.84,2.52,That incredible thing immediately slammed into a wall
26.06,29.12,3.06,and hitting that wall forced someone
29.24,31.96,2.72,"to invent the next breakthrough, like dominoes falling."
32.82,33.88,1.06,Except nobody set them up.
33.90,36.28,2.38,They just fell.
37.32,39.28,1.96,"One after another, unstoppable."
40.44,41.02,0.58,Seven years.
41.90,45.12,3.22,That's all it took from that paper to AI agents
45.22,47.18,1.96,that can reason and plan like humans.
48.30,49.98,1.68,"Not because anyone designed it that way,"
50.76,52.78,2.02,because each limitation left no other choice.
53.46,54.86,1.40,The chain was inevitable.
56.06,57.28,1.22,Let me show you how it happened.
57.76,61.80,4.04,"The foundation, how attention actually works, transformers,"
62.50,65.76,3.26,"the innovation that started everything, the key idea,"
66.86,68.60,1.74,"generate text one word at a time,"
68.88,71.66,2.78,"left to right, each word only knows what came before it."
72.84,73.86,1.02,Never what comes after.
75.02,76.94,1.92,This is called auto regressive generation
77.08,79.84,2.76,"and it sounds simple, but it unlocked everything."
80.70,82.98,2.28,Inside the decoder sits the attention mechanism.
83.30,86.62,3.32,"And this, this is what we need to understand."
87.52,90.02,2.50,Because everything that came after builds on this one idea.
90.62,92.92,2.30,Watch what happens when the model generates the sentence.
93.96,95.18,1.22,The cat sat on the mat.
95.56,96.50,0.94,We're at the last word.
96.50,98.42,1.92,The model needs to predict mat.
99.48,100.68,1.20,"But to predict it accurately,"
100.68,103.10,2.42,it needs to know which previous words actually matter.
104.00,104.92,0.92,Is cat important?
105.22,105.79,0.57,Probably not.
105.79,106.68,0.89,Is on important?
107.26,107.50,0.24,Very.
108.14,109.24,1.10,That's what attention solves.
109.46,112.28,2.82,It lets the model look at every previous word and decide.
113.24,115.72,2.48,How relevant is this word to what I'm generating right now?
116.92,117.60,0.68,Here's how it works.
117.92,120.28,2.36,"For every word, the model computes three things."
121.64,121.96,0.32,Query.
123.22,124.08,0.86,What am I looking for?
125.22,128.36,3.14,"The current word asking what context it needs, key."
129.36,130.10,0.74,What do I represent?
131.34,134.14,2.80,"Every previous word advertising what it contains, value."
135.24,136.10,0.86,Here's what I'll contribute.
136.22,138.38,2.16,The actual information each word carries.
139.00,139.54,0.54,Now the math.
140.48,142.18,1.70,Take the query and compare it to every key.
142.18,143.82,1.64,This gives you similarity scores.
144.96,146.88,1.92,Turn those scores into weights that sum to one.
147.74,151.52,3.78,"Finally, use those weights to mix together all the values."
152.28,154.28,2.00,Words you paid more attention to contribute more.
154.90,156.36,1.46,Words you ignored contribute less.
156.86,157.48,0.62,That's your output.
157.54,159.62,2.08,A weighted blend of all previous words.
161.12,162.36,1.24,Now watch what actually happens.
162.58,166.28,3.70,"When generating mat, the model pays huge attention to the and on."
166.50,169.44,2.94,Like 70% of its attention goes to those two words.
169.58,170.86,1.28,But cat and sat?
171.34,171.90,0.56,Almost nothing.
173.06,173.30,0.24,Why?
174.12,175.06,0.94,Nobody programmed this.
175.22,177.60,2.38,The model learned from billions of examples.
178.24,182.04,3.80,"It saw on the mat, on the floor, on the table."
182.62,185.46,2.84,"So many times that it figured out, after on the,"
185.78,186.90,1.12,you usually get a surface.
188.10,190.02,1.92,This pattern emerged purely from data.
190.84,192.22,1.38,That's what's wild about attention.
192.34,195.24,2.90,The model discovers which words matter just from exposure.
196.42,198.10,1.68,"No explicit rules, just patterns."
198.78,200.96,2.18,"And because each word only sees backwards,"
201.12,203.10,1.98,"never forward, you can keep generating."
203.48,204.92,1.44,"Word after word, that's the loop."
206.42,207.70,1.28,But here's where it gets interesting.
209.20,209.68,0.48,Temperature.
210.56,213.24,2.68,Temperature controls how the model picks the next word.
213.58,214.40,0.82,Think of it like this.
214.80,217.72,2.92,The model has a probability for every possible next word.
218.74,222.44,3.70,Mat 60% floor 25% rug 12%.
223.26,225.00,1.74,Temperature reshapes these probabilities.
225.74,226.88,1.14,Temperature 0.1?
227.76,229.42,1.66,The model becomes almost deterministic.
230.46,232.90,2.44,Mat shoots up to 99% predictable boring.
233.56,235.46,1.90,"Temperature 1, that's the natural distribution."
236.54,239.10,2.56,Mat 60% floor 25% balanced.
240.32,241.94,1.62,"Temperature 2, everything flattens."
243.06,246.92,3.86,"Mat drops to 35%, even weird options get decent probability."
248.16,249.72,1.56,"Creative, sometimes weird."
250.88,252.54,1.66,So temperature isn't just randomness.
252.68,254.43,1.75,It's like choosing between autopilot
254.43,256.70,2.27,and manual steering through probability space.
257.62,259.14,1.52,Low temperature is autopilot.
259.90,261.28,1.38,Always takes the safest path.
262.16,263.34,1.18,High temperature is manual.
264.16,265.38,1.22,Sometimes brilliant roots.
266.18,267.54,1.36,Sometimes you drive off a cliff.
268.26,269.64,1.38,So GPT 3 launches.
270.56,271.90,1.34,And it's genuinely impressive.
272.86,273.92,1.06,Can complete your code.
274.74,275.68,0.94,Write in different styles.
276.74,277.52,0.78,People are amazed.
278.30,281.90,3.60,"But then someone asks, what's the capital of France?"
283.20,284.14,0.94,"Simple question, right?"
284.86,287.82,2.96,"And it goes, what's the capital of Spain?"
288.84,290.02,1.18,What's the capital of Germany?
291.22,292.30,1.08,The weather is nice today.
293.00,294.78,1.78,Did you know France has excellent wine?
295.84,297.88,2.04,"And you're sitting there like, what?"
298.04,299.06,1.02,What just happened?
299.86,301.34,1.48,The model isn't broken.
302.18,304.16,1.98,It's doing exactly what it was trained to do.
305.34,307.40,2.06,The training objective was predict the next word
307.40,308.80,1.40,based on all previous words.
309.18,309.66,0.48,That's it.
310.02,311.92,1.90,And it was trained on internet text.
312.98,314.72,1.74,Internet text is full of forum threads
314.82,317.30,2.48,where someone asks a question and the responses ramble.
318.66,319.18,0.52,Topic drift.
320.28,320.76,0.48,Tangents.
321.92,324.50,2.58,That pattern exists everywhere in the training data.
325.38,327.80,2.42,"So when you ask, what's the capital of France?"
328.26,329.10,0.84,The model.
330.28,332.14,1.86,Generates what would plausibly come next
332.26,333.50,1.24,in an internet conversation.
334.26,335.24,0.98,And that might be rambling.
335.86,336.84,0.98,That's limitation one.
338.02,339.88,1.86,The model has no concept of being helpful.
340.46,340.64,0.18,None.
341.40,341.66,0.26,Zero.
342.60,343.84,1.24,It's just predicting text.
344.38,345.78,1.40,It doesn't know what you actually want.
346.28,348.08,1.80,"It's a prediction engine, nothing more,"
348.70,351.12,2.42,which meant someone had to teach it what helpful actually
351.12,351.58,0.46,means.
353.18,353.84,0.66,Teaching models.
355.28,355.92,0.64,What we want.
356.38,358.62,2.24,Remember that unhelpful GPT3?
359.20,360.28,1.08,Here's how they fixed it.
361.18,362.68,1.50,And the solution is kind of genius.
363.14,365.34,2.20,You can't just write a loss function for be helpful.
366.74,368.80,2.06,What's the mathematical definition of helpfulness?
369.26,369.86,0.60,There isn't one.
370.72,372.36,1.64,And you can't just show it examples either.
373.24,375.00,1.76,You'd need millions of perfect responses
375.16,376.36,1.20,for every possible question.
376.70,377.90,1.20,That doesn't scale.
378.40,379.26,0.86,So they got creative.
379.34,380.76,1.42,They used human preferences.
381.74,382.42,0.68,Here's the insight.
383.36,386.14,2.78,Humans are terrible at rating things on an absolute scale.
387.44,389.86,2.42,Is this response 7 out of 10 or 8 out of 10?
390.94,393.46,2.52,"Hard to say, but humans are excellent at comparisons."
394.90,396.88,1.98,Is response A better than response B?
397.88,398.18,0.30,Instant.
398.26,398.80,0.54,Easy.
399.24,400.20,0.96,So here's what they did.
401.20,403.60,2.40,Generate two different responses to the same question.
404.60,405.30,0.70,Show them to a human.
405.82,407.16,1.34,Human picks which one is better.
407.82,409.10,1.28,Do this thousands of times.
410.14,412.70,2.56,"Now you have a data set of preferences, comparisons."
413.66,415.54,1.88,Then train a model to predict these preferences.
416.52,419.06,2.54,The model learns to score responses the way a human would.
419.64,421.00,1.36,This becomes your reward model.
421.90,424.74,2.84,This whole process is called RLHF.
426.06,427.92,1.86,Reinforcement learning from human feedback.
429.48,430.10,0.62,Three stages.
431.10,431.62,0.52,Stage one.
432.72,434.86,2.14,Fine-tune the base model on curated examples.
435.84,437.16,1.32,Gets you maybe 80% there.
437.96,438.60,0.64,Stage two.
438.98,441.36,2.38,Train that reward model on human comparisons.
442.12,444.00,1.88,Now you can score any response automatically.
445.04,445.60,0.56,Stage three.
446.18,448.66,2.48,Use reinforcement learning to optimize your language model.
449.64,450.48,0.84,Generator response.
450.98,451.33,0.35,Score it.
451.33,452.40,1.07,Update the model.
453.20,454.10,0.90,But here's the catch.
454.30,457.48,3.18,"If you just maximize the reward, the model breaks."
457.62,459.14,1.52,It discovers exploits.
460.32,462.80,2.48,Maybe it learns that really long responses score well.
463.56,465.74,2.18,"So it generates 5,000 words of repetition."
466.76,467.24,0.48,High score.
467.50,468.36,0.86,Useless.
468.82,470.88,2.06,The model hacks the reward function.
471.70,473.00,1.30,So the objective has a constraint.
473.02,475.52,2.50,"Maximize reward, but don't drift too far"
475.52,476.50,0.98,from the original model.
477.64,478.60,0.96,Think of it like a leash.
479.14,481.86,2.72,"The model can explore, but only so far."
482.02,484.18,2.16,This keeps it tethered to the original model
484.20,485.82,1.62,which actually knows how to speak English.
486.42,488.88,2.46,"Technically, this is measured with KL divergence."
489.64,491.72,2.08,"If your new model assigns very different probabilities,"
491.88,492.83,0.95,you penalize it.
492.83,496.40,3.57,There's a parameter beta that controls how tight the leash is.
497.48,497.92,0.44,Too tight.
498.38,499.18,0.80,Model can't improve.
499.62,500.12,0.50,Too loose.
500.42,502.34,1.92,Model forgets language while chasing the reward.
503.70,504.90,1.20,Getting this right is critical.
504.90,508.30,3.40,"So before RLHF, you ask, what's the weather?"
508.30,511.52,3.22,And you get the weather is the state of the atmosphere.
513.06,513.56,0.50,Wikipedia facts.
514.60,515.22,0.62,Unhelpful.
516.26,518.02,1.76,"After RLHF, same question."
519.16,520.71,1.55,"I don't have access to current weather data,"
520.71,521.94,1.23,but I can help you find it.
522.38,523.72,1.34,What location are you asking about?
524.92,525.54,0.62,See the difference?
525.98,526.50,0.52,Night and day.
527.72,529.36,1.64,But notice what it still can't do.
529.62,531.48,1.86,It can't actually check the weather.
531.74,533.56,1.82,It's still just generating text.
534.52,535.34,0.82,Limitation two.
536.16,537.20,1.04,Can't take real actions.
537.98,541.64,3.66,And that limitation led directly to the next breakthrough.
543.22,545.44,2.22,Giving model's hands function calling.
546.02,547.02,1.00,Here's the key insight.
547.84,550.21,2.37,What if we train the model to output structured data
550.21,553.50,3.29,"that our code can intercept and execute, not just text,"
553.72,555.24,1.52,"instructions, function calls?"
556.80,557.58,0.78,Here's how it works.
557.74,560.32,2.58,"You define a function, something like get weather."
560.98,562.58,1.60,Parameters are location and unit.
563.42,565.78,2.36,This function definition goes into the model's context.
565.82,568.86,3.04,"User asks, what's the weather in Tokyo?"
569.58,571.68,2.10,The model generates structured JSON.
571.68,573.36,1.68,Function name is get weather.
574.60,576.86,2.26,"Arguments are location, Tokyo, and unit Celsius."
578.06,580.66,2.60,Your code intercepts this and executes the actual function.
582.14,583.38,1.24,Makes a real API call.
583.38,584.64,1.26,Real data comes back.
585.56,587.58,2.02,"Temperature 22, condition sunny."
588.42,590.42,2.00,This result goes back into the model's context.
591.06,592.50,1.44,The model generates again.
593.50,596.46,2.96,It's 22 degrees Celsius and sunny and Tokyo right now.
597.64,598.56,0.92,Look at what just happened.
598.74,600.80,2.06,The model made a decision to call a function
600.82,602.16,1.34,instead of answering directly.
602.96,605.00,2.04,It extracted the parameters from natural language
605.02,606.38,1.36,and this unlocked everything.
607.88,608.88,1.00,Calculator for math.
609.46,610.70,1.24,Search for current information.
611.96,612.68,0.72,Database queries.
613.44,613.72,0.28,Email.
614.38,615.00,0.62,File access.
615.64,616.38,0.74,Code execution.
617.60,619.44,1.84,The model can now touch the real world.
619.78,625.14,5.36,"But then someone says, plan my Europe trip and watch what happens."
626.38,628.00,1.62,The model calls search flights.
628.06,629.62,1.56,Gets back 50 options.
630.64,632.98,2.34,"That's about 10,000 tokens flooding into the context."
634.00,634.88,0.88,Call search hotels.
635.64,636.94,1.30,"Another 8,000 tokens."
637.62,638.46,0.84,Transport options.
639.16,640.04,0.88,"5,000 more."
640.86,642.36,1.50,"We're at 23,000 tokens."
643.04,645.82,2.78,"Just for one city, the context window has limits."
646.60,648.96,2.36,"Early GPT-4 had 8,000 tokens."
649.88,651.52,1.64,"Later extended to 32,000."
652.56,655.46,2.90,"More importantly, complex tasks need many function calls."
656.12,657.92,1.80,Each one dumps data into the context.
659.04,661.96,2.92,"After 10 or 12 calls, you overflow."
662.76,663.76,1.00,The context is full.
664.36,665.00,0.64,Mid-task.
665.46,666.38,0.92,The whole thing crashes.
667.54,668.34,0.80,Limitation three.
668.86,671.28,2.42,Multi-step tasks overflow the context window.
671.90,673.16,1.26,Someone needed to solve this.
674.52,675.59,1.07,Breaking down complexity.
675.59,676.34,0.75,Work flows.
677.26,678.14,0.88,Here's the core insight.
679.26,680.88,1.62,Don't keep everything in one context.
681.48,682.62,1.14,Break the task into steps.
683.70,685.22,1.52,Each step has its own context.
685.94,687.66,1.72,Steps only pass forward what's needed.
689.06,689.44,0.38,Summaries.
690.02,690.62,0.60,Not everything.
691.26,692.18,0.92,Think of it like a graph.
692.82,693.48,0.66,Nodes and arrows.
694.22,697.48,3.26,"Each node does one thing, passes outputs to the next node."
698.38,699.92,1.54,Watch this Europe trip workflow.
700.50,701.64,1.14,First node searches flights.
702.34,703.84,1.50,API returns 50 options.
704.48,705.34,0.86,"10,000 tokens."
706.08,708.03,1.95,But this node doesn't pass all of that forward.
708.03,708.74,0.71,It filters.
709.78,710.32,0.54,Top three.
710.60,711.62,1.02,Now it's 600 tokens.
712.76,713.84,1.08,94% reduction.
714.82,716.06,1.24,Second node searches hotels.
716.86,717.82,0.96,Gets 30 hotels.
718.88,719.78,0.90,"8,000 tokens."
720.90,721.90,1.00,Filters to top two.
722.72,724.40,1.68,Passes forward 400 tokens.
725.66,726.96,1.30,Third node handles transport.
728.10,728.86,0.76,20 options.
728.88,730.06,1.18,"5,000 tokens."
730.80,731.74,0.94,Filters to best three.
732.34,733.98,1.64,Passes forward 300 tokens.
735.58,736.20,0.62,See what's happening?
737.58,740.26,2.68,Each node processes massive amounts of data internally.
740.80,742.96,2.16,But it only passes a summary to the next node.
744.50,745.24,0.74,Total context.
746.08,748.12,2.04,600 plus 400 plus 300.
748.76,750.04,1.28,"About 1,300 tokens."
750.90,754.56,3.66,"Instead of 23,000, you've broken the accumulation problem."
754.66,757.26,2.60,And you can implement logic with the graph structure.
758.84,759.58,0.74,Decision nodes.
760.62,761.54,0.92,Parallel execution.
762.72,764.70,1.98,Error handling with exponential back off.
765.82,767.22,1.40,This solved the context problem.
768.20,769.98,1.78,You can chain together dozens of operations
770.04,771.18,1.14,without running out of memory.
772.22,774.72,2.50,But then this happens.
776.08,779.06,2.98,"User says, actually, I want to stop in London"
779.10,780.16,1.06,for two days on the way.
780.86,781.68,0.82,"Simple change, right?"
782.34,784.50,2.16,And your workflow shatters.
784.78,787.90,3.12,Because the graph was designed for one specific path.
788.98,791.66,2.68,"Search direct flight, search hotel, book everything."
792.26,794.08,1.82,It has no nodes for multi-city flights.
794.24,796.02,1.78,You'd have to redesign the entire workflow.
797.00,798.28,1.28,Work flows execute plans.
799.14,801.20,2.06,They're amazing at following a predetermined sequence.
801.92,802.90,0.98,But they don't make plans.
803.34,804.08,0.74,They can't adapt.
805.28,806.02,0.74,Limitation four.
806.62,807.20,0.58,Can't adapt.
808.16,808.48,0.32,Brittle.
808.98,809.36,0.38,Rigid.
810.18,811.24,1.06,Which brings us to agents.
812.28,813.56,1.28,When systems start thinking.
814.26,815.12,0.86,Remember that request?
816.06,818.82,2.76,I want to stop in London for two days on the way to Paris.
819.56,820.82,1.26,The one that shattered the workflow.
821.60,822.04,0.44,Agents.
822.76,824.72,1.96,Agents don't execute predefined steps.
825.12,825.62,0.50,They reason.
825.70,826.66,0.96,They use a loop.
826.82,827.30,0.48,Think.
827.38,828.12,0.74,Act.
828.78,829.60,0.82,Observe what happened.
830.08,830.58,0.50,Think again.
830.70,831.46,0.76,Repeat.
833.06,833.76,0.70,Here's the prompt.
834.64,835.36,0.72,You have these tools.
835.70,838.68,2.98,"Search flights, book hotel, calculate, use this format."
840.06,840.90,0.84,Thought you're reasoning.
841.56,842.78,1.22,"Action, which tool to use."
842.78,844.56,1.78,"Observation, I'll give you the result."
845.52,846.78,1.26,Final answer when you're done.
847.94,848.38,0.44,That's it.
848.90,849.54,0.64,No flow chart.
849.76,850.66,0.90,No hard-coded paths.
850.66,851.90,1.24,Just tools in a format.
852.80,855.68,2.88,"User asks, I want to stop in London for two days"
855.74,856.48,0.74,on the way to Paris.
857.48,858.16,0.68,Iteration one.
859.24,861.79,2.55,"The thought is, user wants a multi-city trip."
861.79,863.98,2.19,I need flights and segments home to London
864.20,864.96,0.76,then London to Paris.
866.26,867.44,1.18,Where did this plan come from?
868.92,869.97,1.05,Nobody programmed this.
869.97,871.32,1.35,The model figured it out.
871.98,874.12,2.14,"It has seen multi-city trips in its training data,"
874.22,875.68,1.46,"learned the pattern, applied it here."
876.72,878.08,1.36,The action is search multi-city.
878.08,880.04,1.96,San Francisco to London then London to Paris.
880.84,881.98,1.14,Your code executes this.
882.18,885.26,3.08,"12 options, 450 to 890 pounds."
886.22,888.54,2.32,"The observation comes back, found 12 options."
888.86,890.80,1.94,This goes into the model's context.
890.84,892.32,1.48,The model generates again.
893.60,894.24,0.64,Iteration two.
895.26,897.26,2.00,"The thought is, got flights."
898.38,900.36,1.98,Now I need London accommodation for two nights.
900.78,903.58,2.80,The model remembered two days from the original request.
904.28,905.28,1.00,"Memory, reasoning."
906.20,908.52,2.32,The action is search hotels in London for two nights.
909.22,912.14,2.92,"Eight hotels, 120 to 350 pounds per night."
912.68,913.40,0.72,Iteration three.
914.54,917.58,3.04,"The thought is, better check the total cost before booking."
918.64,919.78,1.14,Nobody told it to do this.
920.60,923.20,2.60,"But the agent reasoned, before spending money,"
923.40,924.32,0.92,verify the cost.
924.58,925.70,1.12,This is strategic thinking.
926.32,929.35,3.03,"Emerging from the language model, the action is calculate."
929.35,932.82,3.47,890 plus two times 180 plus 150.
934.58,935.52,0.94,1400 pounds.
936.08,936.82,0.74,Iteration four.
936.94,939.32,2.38,"The thought is, budget looks good."
939.68,940.42,0.74,Let's book everything.
942.02,943.58,1.56,The action is book multi-city.
944.24,944.94,0.70,Booking confirmed.
945.24,945.82,0.58,Final answer.
947.08,947.56,0.48,All booked.
948.56,951.24,2.68,You'll be in London June 15th through 17th at Hotel Strand
951.36,953.44,2.08,"then Paris, June 17th through 24th."
954.90,957.64,2.74,"That workflow that completely shattered, the agent just"
957.64,958.08,0.44,solved it.
958.44,959.78,1.34,"First try, no redesign."
960.74,962.14,1.40,Think about what it did autonomously.
962.98,963.80,0.82,Broke down the problem.
964.80,967.86,3.06,"Chose which tools to use and when, made decisions,"
968.68,970.66,1.98,executed four tool calls in sequence.
971.62,973.92,2.30,Synthesized everything into a coherent answer.
974.48,975.72,1.24,You didn't program this logic.
975.96,977.36,1.40,You gave it tools and a goal.
978.02,978.94,0.92,It figured out the rest.
979.60,980.24,0.64,Here's what matters.
981.20,983.28,2.08,"Agents don't just execute, they think."
984.00,986.86,2.86,"Each iteration, the model sees the full history, every thought,"
986.88,988.24,1.36,"every action, every result."
989.22,991.80,2.58,It conditions on that history to decide what to do next.
991.98,994.62,2.64,The same loop handles simple and complex tasks.
996.18,997.00,0.82,What's two plus two?
997.98,998.50,0.52,One iteration.
1000.04,1001.70,1.66,Plan my Europe trip with multiple stops.
1003.20,1003.78,0.58,Ten iterations.
1003.86,1004.98,1.12,Same mechanism.
1006.12,1007.02,0.90,But there's a trade-off.
1007.46,1009.06,1.60,"Workflows are predictable, reliable."
1009.68,1011.56,1.88,"Agents are flexible, but unpredictable."
1012.66,1014.96,2.30,"Sometimes brilliant, sometimes stuck in loops."
1015.64,1016.44,0.80,This is the frontier.
1017.08,1019.94,2.86,"Agents unlock adaptive reasoning, but they're less reliable."
1020.48,1021.28,0.80,The complete chain.
1021.90,1022.96,1.06,Here's the complete chain.
1023.58,1025.44,1.86,"2017, Transformers."
1026.48,1028.36,1.88,Unlocked text generation through attention.
1028.76,1029.24,0.48,Hit the wall.
1029.82,1030.94,1.12,No concept of being helpful.
1032.98,1033.00,0.02,2020.
1034.10,1035.50,1.40,RLHF.
1036.76,1038.40,1.64,Unlocked alignment with human preferences.
1039.50,1040.02,0.52,Hit the wall.
1041.20,1042.24,1.04,Can't take real actions.
1043.24,1044.10,0.86,2022.
1045.02,1045.60,0.58,Function calling.
1046.20,1047.42,1.22,Unlocked real tool use.
1048.30,1048.82,0.52,Hit the wall.
1049.84,1051.86,2.02,Context explodes on multi-step tasks.
1052.76,1053.46,0.70,2023.
1053.50,1054.40,0.90,Workflows.
1055.34,1057.70,2.36,Unlocked complex orchestration with bounded context.
1058.86,1059.36,0.50,Hit the wall.
1060.28,1061.42,1.14,Can't adapt to new requirements.
1062.32,1062.98,0.66,2024.
1063.90,1064.38,0.48,Agents.
1064.96,1067.56,2.60,Unlocked adaptive reasoning through think-act-observe loops.
1068.74,1069.24,0.50,Trade-off.
1070.06,1071.84,1.78,"Less predictable, but far more flexible."
1073.34,1073.90,0.56,See the pattern?
1075.34,1077.40,2.06,Each breakthrough unlocked new capabilities.
1078.12,1079.58,1.46,Each capability hit a hard limit.
1079.88,1081.32,1.44,Each limit forced the next invention.
1081.46,1082.20,0.74,This wasn't planned.
1082.44,1083.04,0.60,It was inevitable.
1084.02,1085.68,1.66,Each step made the next step necessary.
1087.20,1088.52,1.32,The limitations were in bugs.
1089.10,1091.54,2.44,They were signposts pointing to what needed to be invented
1091.58,1091.98,0.40,next.
1092.52,1093.12,0.60,Seven years.
1094.20,1096.74,2.54,"From attention is all you need to agents that can reason and plan,"
1096.92,1098.36,1.44,"not because someone designed it that way,"
1099.06,1100.58,1.52,because it couldn't have happened any other way.
1101.58,1102.52,0.94,The chain was inevitable.
1103.50,1104.20,0.70,Thanks for watching.
